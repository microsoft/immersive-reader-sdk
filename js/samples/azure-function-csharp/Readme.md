## Usage

In order to use this Azure function in your apps you can either run it locally by following the steps below or go to **Deploy Function into Azure** section.

1. Open **AzureFunction-csharp** folder in VSCode.

1. Install Azure Functions Core Tools, it lets you develop and test your functions on your local computer from the command prompt or terminal.

    > npm i -g -azure-functions-core-tools

1. Install the required dependencies using VSCode Terminal. It uses the developer's credentials to authenticate to Azure services during local development.

    > dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication --version 1.6.1

1. Replace the `<subdomain>` placeholder value with your own subdomain value on the subdomain variable in **ManagedIdentityAzureADTokenProvider.cs**. Subdomain value is generated when creating your Immersive Reader resource as described in the **Prerequisites** section.

1. Run the command below to test the function locally.

    > func host start

    The command output will show the function name followed by the function URL to be used in you application, you can notice that GET and POST requests are allowed by the function.
