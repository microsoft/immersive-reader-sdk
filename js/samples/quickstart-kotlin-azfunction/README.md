# Immersive Reader - Quickstart Android Kotlin calling Azure Function

This code sample shows how to get an Azure AD token from an Azure function.

## Prerequisites

* A function up and running either locally or deployed into Azure, see this [Azure function code sample](https://github.com/microsoft/immersive-reader-sdk/tree/master/js/samples/azure-function-csharp).
    * For using the function locally you must have the code sample above setup and running to get the `<YOUR_FUNCTION_LOCAL>` value.

        Follow the steps in the sample and run the function either pressing **F5** or with the command below:

        > func host start

    * Or you must deploy the function to Azure, follow the steps in the sample in the **Deploy Function into Azure** to get the `<YOUR_FUNCTION_URL>` value.

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Usage

1. Launch Android Studio and open the project from the **immersive-reader-sdk/js/samples/quickstart-kotlin-azfunction** directory.

1. Create a file named **env** to the **/assets** folder and add the following, supplying values according to **Prerequisites** section. Be sure not to commit this file into source control, as it contains secrets that should not be made public.

    ```text
    FUNCTION_URL=<YOUR_FUNCTION_URL>
    FUNCTION_API_KEY=<YOUR_FUNCTION_APIKEY>
    FUNCTION_URL_LOCAL=<YOUR_FUNCTION_LOCAL>
    ```

1. Make sure to specify in **\app\src\main\java\com\example\immersivereadersdk\MainActivity.kt** where do you want to get the function url. Set the **tokenFrom** variable accordingly.

1. Choose a device emulator from the AVD Manager and run the project.

## Disclaimer

This approach is for development purposes only and is not how this should be used in Production.

That Production auth is beyond the scope of this sample.
