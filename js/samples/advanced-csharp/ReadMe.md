# Immersive Reader - Advanced Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates more of the functionality provided by the Immersive Reader, such as rendering math content, rendering content that contains multiple languages, setting the language of the Immersive Reader UI, and rendering Microsoft Word documents.

This sample also demonstrates how to use a canary to improve security in your web app. A canary is a short-lived, server-generated token, which is generated during an authenticated call to the server. Later, when the user invokes the Immersive Reader, the canary is used to authenticate the call to the server. This mechanism improves security because it adds authentication to the call to launch the Immersive Reader.

## Prerequisites

* An Immersive Reader resource configured for Azure Active Directory authentication. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applied-ai-services/immersive-reader/how-to-create-immersive-reader) to get set up. You will need some of the values created here when configuring the sample project properties. Save the output of your session into a text file for future reference.
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)

## Usage
