## Usage

1. Open **MultipleResourcesSampleWebApp.sln** in Visual Studio.

1. Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose **Manage User Secrets**. This will open a file called **secrets.json**. Replace the contents of that file with the following, supplying your values as appropriate:

    ```json
    {
        "ImmersiveReaderResourceOne":
        {
            "TenantId": YOUR_FIRST_TENANT_ID,
            "ClientId": YOUR_FIRST_CLIENT_ID,
            "ClientSecret": YOUR_FIRST_CLIENT_SECRET,
            "Subdomain": YOUR_FIRST_SUBDOMAIN
        },
        "ImmersiveReaderResourceTwo":
        {
            "TenantId": YOUR_SECOND_TENANT_ID,
            "ClientId": YOUR_SECOND_CLIENT_ID,
            "ClientSecret": YOUR_SECOND_CLIENT_SECRET,
            "Subdomain": YOUR_SECOND_SUBDOMAIN
        }
    }
    ```
